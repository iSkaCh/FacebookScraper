# FacebookScraper

This is a facebook scraper that was used for a school project, it uses the Selenium framework.

It is inspired by the FacebookBot found here https://github.com/hikaruAi/FacebookBot

This script extract, to this date, every facebook comment and post but it is kind of slow.

Hope it helps!
